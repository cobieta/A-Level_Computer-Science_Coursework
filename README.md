# A-Level_Computer-Science_Coursework

This is the repositry for my A Level Computer Science coursework project, where I created a game in Unity with C#. I made an Android app for practicing mental maths skills that also tracked how you improved. It was designed to be a dungeon crawler game that improves your mental maths, where the dungeons and maths questions were procedurally generated. I worked on this during 2017 and 2018. This repository inlcudes the final report I wrote and a runnable PC version of the game. 

*Since I have only recently created this Github account, the project source files have not been added to this repository yet because they are stored on a backup that I don't have physical access to at the moment. They will be available from 11th December when I have access again. Feel free to downlaod the game files to run and have a look at the report I wrote for this project in the meantime.*
