# A-Level_Computer-Science_Coursework

This is the repository for my A Level Computer Science coursework project, where I created a game in Unity with C#. I made an Android app for practicing mental maths skills that also tracked how you improved. It was designed to be a dungeon crawler game that improves your mental maths, where the dungeons and maths questions were procedurally generated. I worked on this during 2017 and 2018. This repository includes the final report I wrote and a runnable PC version of the game which you can play by downloading the correct PC Game build folder for your system (either the x86 or x64 one). The Unity project files can be found in the x folder.
